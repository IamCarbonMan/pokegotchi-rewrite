- connect auth0 and allow users to backup their key and optionally all of their data (if auth0 allows this) to it
- configurable sprites
- css grid
- consider allowing nested data in gun and refactor the `.on()` listener in `subscribe` to re-get the node and call `.load()` (since calling it on the callback `data` arg itself apparently doesn't work). unsure what issues (proably performance) this might cause
- current item inventory: evolution items, form change items, gacha tokens, berries, tera shards
    - dudunsparce ??
    - tandemaus ??
    - meltan??
- minigames!
    - can boost happiness, but mostly are just a decent way to farm coins unlimitedly
    - can have little easter eggs that unlock access to rare items/pokemon
    - chrome offline dinosaur
- bottom bar can have a little graphic corresponding to the pokemon's type??
- theming
- tera type
- pet actions:
    - pet (unlimited use, +1 happiness only when used less than 3 times today?, gives coins equal to happiness threshold (1-5) on these uses)
    - feed (single use per 6 hours?, adds happiness based on berry preference)
    - play (minigame, gives happiness based on score (limited per day?) and coins (unlimited?))
- mobile vs desktop layout
- clipping
- some sprites are too big
- *sound*
- find/create sprites for all the various items
- goodies function drops type-tokens, type-shards, random berries, and/or related evolution items
- finish implementing forms, implement legendaries but filter them out by default
- fixname for calyrex, zygarde
- pokedex???
- lose happiness if you ignore them (box not included??)
- be sure to carry all formes across evolutions
- forme change items
    - formeFilter can be reduced and eventually gimmickFilter
- start using `Dex.species.get` for types instead of storing them on the mon
    - in fact, with proper memoization the data stored should only be
        id, tera?, nickname?, happiness, gender, shiny
    - fixName needs to operate on id instead of name
